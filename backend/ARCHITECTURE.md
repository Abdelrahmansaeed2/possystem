# Backend Architecture Overview

## Overall Approach and Design Decisions

The Café POS Pro backend system is built using a **modern, enterprise-grade Node.js architecture** that prioritizes scalability, maintainability, and real-time performance. Our architectural approach follows **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)** principles with a **layered architecture** pattern, ensuring clear separation of concerns and high testability.

### Core Architectural Decisions

**Technology Stack Selection**: We chose **TypeScript** as our primary language for its strong typing system and enhanced developer experience, paired with **Express.js** for its mature ecosystem and flexibility. **Prisma ORM** serves as our database abstraction layer, providing type-safe database operations and excellent migration management. **Redis** handles caching, session management, and real-time data synchronization, while **Socket.IO** enables bidirectional real-time communication for live order updates and kitchen management.

**Service-Oriented Architecture**: The system implements a **service layer pattern** where business logic is encapsulated in dedicated service classes (`OrderService`, `CustomerService`, `InventoryService`). This approach promotes code reusability, makes testing easier, and allows for future microservices migration if needed. Each service handles a specific business domain and maintains its own data access patterns.

**Security-First Design**: We implemented **JWT-based authentication** with **role-based access control (RBAC)** and **permission-based authorization**. API keys provide an additional security layer, while Redis-based session management enables secure logout and token blacklisting. All sensitive operations are logged for audit trails, and rate limiting prevents abuse.

**Real-Time Architecture**: The WebSocket implementation uses **room-based broadcasting** to ensure users only receive relevant updates. Kitchen staff get order updates for their location, managers receive analytics in real-time, and customers get order status notifications. This approach minimizes bandwidth usage while maintaining responsive user experiences.

**Error Handling Strategy**: We implemented a **centralized error handling system** with custom error classes for different scenarios (ValidationError, AuthenticationError, etc.). All errors are properly logged with context, and the system gracefully handles database failures, external service outages, and validation issues while providing meaningful feedback to clients.

**Observability and Monitoring**: The logging system uses **structured logging** with Winston, featuring different log levels, daily rotation, and category-based loggers for different business domains. Performance monitoring tracks response times, database query performance, and system resource usage. This comprehensive observability enables proactive issue detection and system optimization.

**Data Consistency and Transactions**: Critical operations like order processing and payment handling use **database transactions** to ensure data consistency. The system implements **optimistic locking** for inventory updates and uses Redis for distributed locking when needed. This approach prevents race conditions while maintaining high performance.

**Scalability Considerations**: The architecture supports **horizontal scaling** through stateless design, Redis-based session storage, and database connection pooling. The service layer can be easily extracted into microservices, and the WebSocket system supports clustering through Redis pub/sub. Environment-based configuration enables seamless deployment across different environments.

This architectural approach ensures the system can handle high-volume café operations while maintaining data integrity, providing real-time updates, and supporting future growth and feature expansion.
